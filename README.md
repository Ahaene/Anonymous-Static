## Anonymous

Anonymous-Static is an easy to setup unblocker for you to deploy.

## Setup

###### WARNING: Anonymous WILL NOT work on your computer hosted locally and there will be a lot of errors. Please, if you don't know what you're doing, use an online service like Replit. Hosting locally is only for educational purposes.

First, download git CLI to your computer and open up the command line inside where you want the project to go.
If you're using a service like Replit, skip this step.

Next, type, ```git clone https://github.com/oHeckGage/Anonymous-Static``` or if you're on a website, Import from Github using that URL.

Replit is already setup with Particles.js using Nix but if you're using a local setup, download Node JS. After you've downloaded node, type ```npm install particlesjs```.
If you don't want Particles on your site at all, skip that step since the only dependency is Particles.js for the background.
